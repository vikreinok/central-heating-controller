# Central heating controller

A product developed during my early days in late teens (High school times)

## Description
What is a central heating controller. It is a device that is located in basements of residential buildings near heat exchanger to control the flow of hot water into the building based on outdoor temperature. 

## Functionality
- Graph based tuning (open loop feedback)
- Control of temperature from building 
- Increase in temperate near 0 degrees celsius
- PID regulation for motorized valve with windup loop (designed my Simulink model)
- 16x2 characters LCD User interface
- Timer for reducing temperature during the night or working hours
- USB debugging functionality 


## Technology stack
- Software written in ANSI-C (CCS compiler)
- PIC 18F series microcontroller
- Debugging Proteus ISIS
- Model MatLab Simulink
- PCB design Proteus Ares 
- PCB design manual

## Contributions
In case someone wants to further develop the product or contribute I am willing to support as much as I can. Mentoring, education al project guidance etc.
